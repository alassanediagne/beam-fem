# Finite Element Method for Euler-Bernoulli beam equation

I created this little project over the course of my Bachelor's thesis in 2023-2024.

It implements the Finite-Element method for the Euler-Bernoulli beam equation, see e.g. [this paper](https://www.civil.iitb.ac.in/~minamdar/ce620/Files/FEA_Beams.pdf).
